rss2irc is an IRC bot that polls a single RSS or Atom feed and announces
new items to an IRC channel, with options for customizing output and
behavior. It aims to be an easy to use, dependable bot that does its job
and creates no problems.

rss2irc was published in 2008 by Don Stewart. Simon Michael took over
maintainership in 2009, with the goal of making a robust low-maintenance
bot to stimulate development in various free/open-source software
communities. It is currently used for several full-time bots including:
\begin{compactitem}
\item hackagebot --- announces new hackage releases in \#haskell
\item hledgerbot --- announces hledger commits in \#ledger
\item zwikicommitbot --- announces Zwiki commits in \#zwiki
\item squeaksobot --- announces Squeak and Smalltalk-related Stack Overflow questions in \#squeak
\item squeakquorabot --- announces Squeak/Smalltalk-related Quora questions in \#squeak
\item etoystrackerbot --- announces new Etoys bugs in \#etoys
\item etoysupdatesbot --- announces Etoys commits in \#etoys
\item planetzopebot --- announces new planet.zope.org posts in \#zope
\end{compactitem}

The project is available under BSD license from its home page at
\url{http://hackage.haskell.org/package/rss2irc}. 

Since last report there has been a great deal of cleanup and
enhancement, but no new release on hackage yet due to an xml-related
memory leak.
